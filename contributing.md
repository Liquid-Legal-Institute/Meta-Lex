# Contribution Guidelines / Meta-Lex Architecture & Style Sheet

## The pull request should have a useful title 
Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title are not informative enough. 
Write about what additions you've made and *why* do you think it is useful. 

## Guidelines
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style)
- Use the following format: `[Relevant Link](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category
- **New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome**
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the [CLP principles](https://github.com/Liquid-Legal-Institute/Common-Legal-Platform).

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.

## Meta-Lex Architecture & Syle Sheet

1. **Priortization**: Being _user-centric_, we order the resources based on the learning curve of likely Meta-Lex users, starting with what’s most approachable and foundational to any learner. 

**Foundational / Beginner**

**Intermediate** 

**Advanced Professional**

**Academic / Researcher / Expert**

2. **Sources**: We present suggested resources in consistent Source categories. If there is nothing noteworthy on the relevant topic in a given Source category, for example, no compelling Videos, then omit this category.  _A curated list means using first-hand experience to make an informed judgment to site visitors who may be less expert. This is LLI and its partners' value-add._

Thus: 

**Books**

**Books (Compendia)**

**Articles** [category includes book reviews and commentaries]

**Studies, Reports, Papers**

**Podcasts & Videos** [only if free-standing; if an interview with an author, include as part of the book or article - see example below] 

**Websites**: [such as an edited or curated online journal, blog or page about Legal Transformation or a major subcategory, e..g., Legal Evolution (Bill Henderson), or LLI’s own curated Legal Text Analytics Resources page]

**Other**: [then so describe]

3. **Sample entry for a book**:

**Book**: The Legal Design Book - Doing Law in the 21st Century / Das Legal Design Buch - So geht Recht im 21. Jahrhundert, …
