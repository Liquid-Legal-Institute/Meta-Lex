## Introduction to Legal Transformation
[Back to Top](#contents)

- **Book**: [Tomorrow’s Lawyers: An Introduction to Your Future, 2nd ed.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198796633/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1496314861&sr=8-2&keywords=susskind) (Prof. [Richard Susskind](https://www.susskind.com), OBE FRSE RSA (Oxford, Strathclyde, Gresham), Oxford Univ. Press, 2016). Prof. Susskind is IT Advisor to Lord Chief Justice of England & Wales, President of the Society of Computers & Law and the leading, most cited commentator on future of legal profession.  Very powerful, easy to read critique of traditional law firm, law school and bar association orthodoxy in US and UK. Applicable to other legal systems and cultures; widely translated. Iconoclastic, thought-provoking, yet hopeful.

- **Book**: [The Future of the Professions: How Technology Will Transform the World of Human Experts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Professions-Technology-Transform-Experts-dp-0198841892/dp/0198841892/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). (Profs. [Richard Susskind](https://www.susskind.com) and [Daniel Susskind](https://www.danielsusskind.com), Oxford Univ. Press, 2016; updated ed. April 2022).  Exactly as the title says; highly acclaimed work.  Slower, harder read than Tomorrow’s Lawyers, but time well spent.  2022 edition is updated for changes over past 6 years, included as accelerated by Covid. Tip: If you have read the original edition, purchase the Kindle version (USD7.99) for the outstanding 2002 update.

- **Book (Compendium)**: [Liquid Legal: Transforming Legal into a Business Savvy, Information Enabled and Performance Driven Industry](https://www.liquid-legal-institute.com/workinggroups/liquid-legal-transforming-legal-into-a-business-savvy-information-enabled-and-performance-driven-industry) (Kai Jacob, Dierk Schindler, Roger Strathausen, ed., Springer 2017).  Foundational essays; very forward thinking.

- **Book (Compendium)**: [Liquid Legal: Towards a Common Legal Platform](https://www.liquid-legal-institute.com/workinggroups/lli-book-clp/) (Kai Jacob, Dierk Schindler, Roger Strathausen, ed., Springer 2020). From Richard Susskind’s foreword: “A strikingly diverse collection … something for everyone in the law …”  Coherently tied together by the authors, with a “running and important theme – the idea of designing and building a common legal platform, a shared resource that could help avoid the reinvention of the wheel  that takes place globally at a regrettable scale.” 

- **Book**: [Successful Digital Transformation in Law Firms: A Question of Culture](https://www.globelawandbusiness.com/books/successful-digital-transformation-in-law-firms-a-question-of-culture). (Isabel Parker, Globe Law and Business, 2021). Well written, edited and laid out as a pure visual and production matter, well documented by endnotes. Most of all, is well supported on all key points by case studies and interviews. The author’s approach is fair and balanced; she recognizes both the undeniable strengths and current limitations of the traditional law firm model in today's rapidly transforming world. She offers several plausible paths that firms can take to rise to the challenge and earnestly commit to putting client service first in today's digital world.  All while being keenly realistic about the likely challenges to be faced and difficult choices to be made. **The extensive treatment of law firm "purpose" and by extension, that of all legal professionals is singular and should inform all professionals as they adapt to the digital age.** Many insights are also readily transferable to in-house with little or no adaptation, whether in informing transformation agenda or in selecting and instructing law firms.

- **Book**: [Building an Outstanding Legal Team](https://www.globelawandbusiness.com/books/building-an-outstanding-legal-team-battle-tested-strategies-from-a-general-counsel) (Bjarne P. Tellmann, Globe Law and Business, 2017). [add description]

- **Articles**: [“Don’t Let the Digital Tail Wag the Transformation Dog: A Digital Transformation Roadmap for Corporate Counsel”](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4021593) (Michele DeStefano,Bjarne P. Tellmann and Daniel Wu, 6 February 2022; last updated 23 May 2022, University of Miami Legal Studies Research Paper No 4021593.  Soon to be published in
